            <h4>About Me </h4>
            <p> I attended Lehman College to obtain a Bachelor degree in Computer Graphics and Imaging. Ever since my earlier years I have been interested in the underlying processes that go into developing video games. I was particularly engrossed in animation and character modeling and have worked to constantly improve my aptitude in those areas. </p>
